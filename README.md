# Image Processing using Tensorflow in Python
The images which we will be working with are black and white images of size 28 x 28 pixels, or 784 pixels total. 
Our features will be the pixel values for each pixel. Either the pixel is "white" (blank with a 0), or there is some pixel value.  
We will try to correctly predict what number is written down based solely on the image data in the form of an array. 

These images look like below:

I was able to acheive an accuracy of 92.5% using basic Tensorflow Approach
